We are BLKOPS, a group of conscientious designers and developers serving a common purpose: aiding those who seek to change the social justice status quo through technology and connected applications. At this moment in human history we have a unique opportunity to provide our community with tools that both strengthen and simplify activism, non-violent protest, and peaceful demonstration.
