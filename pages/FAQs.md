**Why the name "Blkops"?**

To take the words from one of our original members, Blkops is a bit of a "tongue-in-cheek" name that enforces our vision of being a group of African American developers who create tools that help provide services for our community.

Any Black individual who is passionate about the #BlackLivesMatter movement and other movements that affect the Black community, regardless of your coding skill level.
